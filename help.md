The app displays near-real time data from Barrow Strait, in Lancaster Sound in the Canadian Arctic (see in Google maps [here](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/74°34'57.8"N+91°21'56.5"W/@74.5864671,-93.6070419,7z/data=!4m14!1m7!3m6!1s0x51dcc197b1a91ca3:0x80379c9b33cdb19e!2sBarrow+Strait!3b1!8m2!3d74.383333!4d-97.8000001!3m5!1s0x0:0x0!7e2!8m2!3d74.582711!4d-91.3657001?hl=en)).

The data stream consists of: 

1. Water properties (temperature, salinity, etc) from underwater [SeaBird CTD sensors](https://www.seabird.com/moored/sbe-37-sm-smp-smp-odo-microcat/family?productCategoryId=54627473786)

2. Sound, recorded using an [iClisten hydrophone](https://oceansonics.com/products/iclisten-hf/)

3. Ice thickness (really, "ice draft", which is the depth of the ice below the waterline) from an [ASL Ice profiling sonar](https://aslenv.com/ips.html)

4. Water (and ice) currents from a Teledyne RDI [ADCP](http://www.teledynemarine.com/workhorse-sentinel-adcp?BrandID=16)

5. Air temperature and pressure from the observatory shore station, and

6. Weather observations recorded by the ECCC weather station in [Resolute Bay](https://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_data/hourly_data_e.html?hlyRange=2016-01-13%7C2019-10-15&dlyRange=2018-10-29%7C2019-10-15&mlyRange=%7C&StationID=54199&Prov=NU&urlExtension=_e.html&searchType=stnProv&optLimit=yearRange&StartYear=1840&EndYear=2019&selRowPerPage=25&Line=192&Month=10&Day=15&lstProvince=NU&timeframe=1&Year=2019)
